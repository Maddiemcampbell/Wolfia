# Wolfia Take Home Notes

Hi! Thank you for the opportunity to work on this project! I've included some notes about implementation as well as what I would do to improve the project. 
### Impersonation Functionality
##### Impersonation functionality allows internal users (typically administrators) to temporarily take on the identity of another user. This feature is particularly useful for troubleshooting and debugging user-reported issues. Internal users can interact with the application as if they were the external user, gaining insights into any issues the user might be facing.

### Key Components
1.  **Impersonation Endpoint**
    -   An API endpoint `/auth/impersonate` that handles the impersonation request.
2.  **Stopping Impersonation**
    -   An API endpoint `/auth/stop_impersonation` that stops the current impersonation session and reverts back to the internal userâ€™s session.
3.  **Session Management**
    -   User sessions are stored in the database with an `impersonator_id` field that indicates if the session was created by an impersonator.
    - `"/auth/session"` allows me to fetch the current session and if it has an impersonator active, get their name to display on the UI. I only send their name to the frontend rather than the impersonator id for some added security.
### How It Works
#### Step-by-Step Process
1.  **Initiate Impersonation**
    -   The internal user provides the ID of the user they wish to impersonate.
    -   A request is sent to the `/auth/impersonate` endpoint with the client user ID.
2.  **Validation**
    -   The server checks if the provided client user ID exists and whether the internal user is authorized to perform impersonation.
3.  **Session Creation**
    -   A new JWT token is generated for the client user, including the `impersonator_id` field to indicate the session was created via impersonation.
    -   This token is set in the response cookie, effectively logging the internal user in as the client user.
4.  **Session Storage**
    -   The new session is stored in the database with details of the impersonation, including the impersonator's ID.
5.  **Using the Impersonated Session**
    -   The internal user now has access to the application as if they were the client user.
    -   Any actions taken are logged under the client user's account but can be traced back to the internal user via the `impersonator_id`.
6.  **Stop Impersonation**
    -   The internal user can stop impersonating by hitting the `/auth/stop_impersonation` endpoint.
    -   This clears the impersonation session and logs the user back into their original internal account.

## Improvements
If given more time, the following features and improvements could be implemented:
1.  **Enhanced Security**
    -   Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for sensitive operations.
    -   Regularly rotate JWT secret keys and sessions.
2.  **User Activity Logging**
    -   Enhance current user logging
3.  **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
    -   Implement a more granular RBAC system to control permissions and access levels for different user roles.
4.  **Scalability Improvements**
    -   Optimize the database for better performance with large datasets.
    -   Implement caching strategies to reduce load on the database.
5.  **User Interface Enhancements**
    -   Improve the frontend design for a better user experience.
6.  **Comprehensive Testing**
    -   Write unit tests and integration tests for all critical components.
    -   Set up continuous integration (CI) to run tests automatically on each push.
